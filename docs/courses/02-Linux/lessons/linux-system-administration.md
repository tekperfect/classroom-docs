## Linux System Administration

File Structure

Root or ground folder on any Linux OS is “/”
From the forward slash or “/” I want you to create the following folders
“cd /” “mkdir tree-trunk” “cd tree-trunk” “mkdir branches” “cd branches” “mkdir leaves”
Creating these folders demonstrates how the linux file structure works.
You have a root level folder which all other directories start from and each folder can contain a multitude of subfolders
