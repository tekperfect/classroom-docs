## Environment Prep

Launch 1 linux instance via the AWS console

Create a label with the Key = Name and the Value = "Your_First_Name Atlassian"
Set the disk space for the instance to 100GB

Download JIRA and Confluence from Atlassians website or the following links

https://tekperfect-devops-uploads.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atlassian-jira-software-8.13.1-x64.bin

https://tekperfect-devops-uploads.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atlassian-confluence-7.8.3-x64.bin

### What command would you use to download these files from the command line of your instance?

Install JIRA

Intall Confluence

Configure accounts on them

Setup your first JIRA project

Switch over to JIRA Service desk and partner with your DevOps Cohort colleagues and switch between a user submitting tickets and a administrator picking up and responding to requests

Now you have a feel for how it is to setup a JIRA & Confluence instance and for the rest of class we are going to focus on the administration tasks associated with managing tickets, a on premise environment, and a cloud environment

For the security group create a new one and call it your_first_name-atlassian and make sure ssh is only open to your IP address by choosing "My IP"
