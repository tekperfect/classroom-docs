## Databases


### What is a Database

A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
For example think about all the tweets you have in your account and when you scroll through a list of tweets from your favorite celebrity. Those tweets are stored in a database and your browsing of those tweets is a query to a structured data set that is retrieved and returned in that application.
