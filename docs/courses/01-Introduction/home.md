## üìò Course Description
> **What is DevOps?**

TekPerfect is partnering with GameHeads to train Bay Area youth for careers in the tech industry. There are many paths to get into tech and many jobs when you think of a ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù. Our bootcamp focuses on ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù (a mixture of development and operations).

Think of an app or video game. You will see a gaming/social experience. But what you don‚Äôt see are the code and the foundation it is built upon. DevOps refers to the infrastructure. No matter what you want to build (app, video game, database), you will need the right infrastructure. This foundation allows the user to see the great product without all the bugs or lags or crashes.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
None! Just bring yourself on time and be dedicated to learn

## üìù Learning Outcomes

- Basic operating systems installation, setup, configuration, and systems administration
